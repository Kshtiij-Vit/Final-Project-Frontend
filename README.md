## Complex CSS Techniques

### Login Page Following Effect
One of the standout features of the web application is the login page following effect, created using CSS pseudo-elements.

#### Implementation Details:
- **Pseudo-elements**: The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are used to create additional elements for styling purposes.
- **Keyframe Animations**: CSS animations are used to create a smooth following effect when the user moves the mouse over the login form.
- **Transformations**: The `transform` property is utilized to move elements based on the user's mouse position.
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions are applied to ensure the effect is visually appealing.
